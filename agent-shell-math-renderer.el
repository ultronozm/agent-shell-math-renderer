;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Display-math support for `agent-shell-markdown': intercept LaTeX
;; display equations in agent output and overlay them with an image.
;;
;; Two block-level delimiter styles are recognized, toggled
;; independently via `agent-shell-math-renderer-delimiters':
;;
;;   bracket  `\[X\]'    (default; unambiguous)
;;   dollar   `$$X$$'    (default; safe because matched block-level only)
;;
;; Inline math `\(X\)' is recognized separately (toggle
;; `agent-shell-math-renderer-render-inline', default on) and typeset
;; in text style.  Inline `$X$' is intentionally not matched — a lone
;; `$' is too common in prose to be safe.
;;
;; The raw LaTeX is kept in the buffer (so copy / save round-trips the
;; source) and, on a graphical display, an equation image is layered on
;; top with a `display' text property.  A blank line can't appear inside
;; LaTeX display math, so a candidate block whose body would span one is
;; rejected — this bounds detection and stops a stray delimiter from
;; swallowing the rest of a streaming response.
;;
;; The renderer plugs into agent-shell only through the public hook
;; `agent-shell-markdown-render-functions': agent-shell's markdown
;; renderer calls `agent-shell-math-renderer--render-hook' once per
;; streaming chunk, after its own passes.  The hook styles the delimiter
;; and inline math, renders fenced math, and returns a watermark when an
;; unclosed block still needs streaming protection.
;;
;; Equations are typeset by compiling a standalone LaTeX document to DVI
;; (`latex') and converting it to SVG (`dvisvgm') — the same toolchain
;; org-latex-preview uses.  Compilation is asynchronous and the SVG is
;; cached on disk by content (so each unique equation compiles at most
;; once); the image is overlaid when ready.  When the toolchain is
;; absent or `agent-shell-math-renderer-use-placeholder' is set, a
;; placeholder panel boxing the raw LaTeX is shown instead.

Each element is a plist (:start S :end E :open O :close C): S..E
spans the whole delimited block (delimiters included), and O / C
are the opening / closing delimiter token lengths, so the LaTeX
body is the buffer text in [S+O, E-C).

Only the delimiter styles listed in
`agent-shell-math-renderer-delimiters' are recognized (`$$...$$'
and/or `\\[...\\]'), and only as BLOCK-LEVEL equations:

  - the opener must start its line (after optional indentation), and
  - the closer must be flush — start or end its line.

Genuinely inline display math is thus not matched; this keeps
prose / currency (`$$') from false-positiving.

Scanning resolves each opener immediately: from just after an
opener, look for the first of its matching flush closer or a blank
line (a paragraph break, which LaTeX display math can't contain).
A closer that is not flush is treated as body and the search
continues.

  - Flush closer first: a valid block, recorded; scanning resumes
    after the closer.
  - Blank line first (or no closer): the opener is a false
    positive, so scanning resumes just after the OPENER, so a real
    block on a later line is still found.
  - Neither yet (end of buffer): a still-streaming block extending
    to `point-max' with :close 0, so a genuine equation stays
    protected as the buffer grows — mirroring how `agent-shell' keeps a
    still-open fenced block protected as it streams.

A delimiter inside any of AVOID-RANGES (a sorted vector, typically
fenced code) is ignored — both openers and closers — so blocks
never overlap AVOID-RANGES.  Because openers are resolved one at a
time and bodies never cross a blank line, returned blocks never
overlap each other.

For example, with `bracket' enabled and buffer \"\\=\\[E=mc^2\\]\",
returns ((:start 1 :end 11 :open 2 :close 2))."

Recognizes the delimiter styles in
`agent-shell-math-renderer-delimiters' (`$$...$$' and/or
`\\[...\\]').  For each complete block with a non-empty body, the
raw delimited text is left in the buffer (so copy / save
round-trips the LaTeX source) and the region is faced with
`agent-shell-math-renderer' and tagged
`agent-shell-markdown-frozen' so later passes and subsequent
streaming calls leave it alone.  The equation image is then
applied by `agent-shell-math-renderer--render' (immediately when
cached, otherwise once an async compile finishes).  Blocks inside
any of AVOID-RANGES (typically fenced code) are left untouched, as
is an empty block.

A block already carrying `agent-shell-math-renderer-source' (one this
pass rendered on an earlier call) is skipped, so re-running over the
same buffer — as the overlay renderer does on every streaming chunk —
does not re-apply finished equations.  Re-rendering for a theme / font
change goes through `agent-shell-math-renderer-refresh' instead, which
walks the `-source' regions directly and never calls this pass.

Adds only text properties (no insert / delete), so the block
positions returned by `agent-shell-math-renderer--blocks' stay
valid while iterating.

For example, with the buffer:

  \\[E=mc^2\\]

the `\\[E=mc^2\\]' text is kept but shows an equation image in its

default) every buffer that has rendered equations.  Call after a
theme, appearance, or font-size change so equation images pick up
the new colors and size.

The pixels-per-point calibration is dropped so it is re-measured
\(e.g. after a display / scaling change); images are then rebuilt at
the current font scale from the on-disk SVGs — cheap, no LaTeX
recompile unless the color also changed.  The in-memory image cache
is keyed per display scale (see
`agent-shell-math-renderer--image-cache-key'), so a new size just
adds entries and a sibling buffer's warm images survive — no clear
needed.  Each re-rendered buffer records its new appearance via
`agent-shell-math-renderer--render', so unchanged buffers stay fast
and untouched buffers refresh lazily when next displayed."

;; don't re-scan the buffer for code / fenced blocks.

  "Render LaTeX math in the current narrowed buffer, for the overlay renderer.

This is the low-level entry point for agent-shell's overlay markdown
renderer (`markdown-overlays-put'), which — unlike the in-place renderer —
does not run `agent-shell-markdown-render-functions', so the package's normal
render hook never fires.  Most users want the ready-made drop-in
`agent-shell-math-renderer-markdown-overlays-put' instead (just set
`agent-shell-markdown-render-function' to it); call this directly only from a
*custom* overlay wrapper, immediately after `markdown-overlays-put', passing
that call's return value:

  (cl-defun my/render (&key render-images highlight-blocks &allow-other-keys)
    (let* ((markdown-overlays-render-images render-images)

returning what `markdown-overlays-put' returned so the wrapper honors that
renderer's contract.  OVERLAYS-RESULT is that alist; two keys are read:

  - `avoided-ranges' — the code / inline-code / table spans the overlay
    renderer protected.  Used verbatim as the math avoid-ranges, so math is
    never detected inside code and stays consistent with what the overlay
    renderer treated as verbatim.
  - `source-blocks' — the fenced code blocks, scanned for ```math /
    ```latex / ```tex to render as display math.

When OVERLAYS-RESULT is nil the passes still run, but with no avoid-ranges
and no fenced math — so pass the value in practice.  A no-op when
`agent-shell-math-renderer-enabled' is nil.

Unlike the in-place render hook, this needs no watermark and freezes no
still-open block: the overlay renderer re-scans the whole (narrowed)
fragment on every streaming chunk, so an equation that is still streaming is
simply left unrendered this pass and picked up once it closes, and an
already-rendered region is re-detected but skipped by each pass (see
