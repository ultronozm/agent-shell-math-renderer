;; isolation.

;; NOTE: these tests call `agent-shell-markdown--deconstruct' (a private
;; agent-shell helper that turns propertized text into (STRING . FACES)
;; runs) for their assertions.  It is the one remaining dependency on an
;; agent-shell internal, and it is deliberately test-only: the shipped
;; package uses only public agent-shell API, so if upstream renames or
;; drops `--deconstruct' it breaks *these tests*, never production.  The
;; fix is then local — adapt the assertions (or inline an equivalent).
